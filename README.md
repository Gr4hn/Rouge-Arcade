# Welcome to "Rouge-Arcade" 🎮
This is a project made by myself [Gr4hn](https://github.com/Gr4hn). 

The project is a game where you can play games like Hangman (the only working game currently), Snake, Connect four and Tic Tac Toe. My plans are to also create games like Battleships etc. - Basicly simple and "easy:er" games.

The game can store players, their score and their levels in the json file, and you can easyly switch between players and also create new players. The program makes sure that the progress that's been made during runtime is saved before exiting the program. 

## My idea 💭
My idea of the project is to educate myself in writing in C/C++, handle databases using nlohmann::json and to create a fun place for people to play games in a basic formfactor.

I hope this arcade finds you well.

## OBS❗
* The program is not written to be safe for commercial use so beware that your data is not "safe" per say while using this program. Your data will be stored in Rouge-Arcade/Players/players.json on your local computer.
